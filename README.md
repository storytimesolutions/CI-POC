# CI-POC
This project is meant to be a proof of concept of how to use GitHub + TravisCI to have a Contintuous Integration environment.  For fun, we use newer technologies as well because we just like to :)

## Getting Started
You will need Git and Node.js installed on your machine.  For Git, I recommended downloading the [GitHub Desktop tool](https://desktop.github.com/) which is OSX and Windows compatible.   

```Powershell
# Clone source code to local computer
git clone https://github.com/storytimesolutions/CI-POC CI-POC
cd CI-POC

# Install dev dependencies
npm install 

# Start server (with tests running :))!
gulp
```
