# CI-POC
This project is meant to be a proof of concept of how to use GitHub + TravisCI to have a Contintuous Integration environment.  For fun, we use newer technologies as well because we just like to :)

## Getting Started
You will need Git and Node.js installed on your machine.  For Git, I recommended downloading the [GitHub Desktop tool](https://desktop.github.com/) which is OSX and Windows compatible.   

1. Clone the project to your machine using command line or GitHub Desktop tool
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/storytimesolutions/CI-POC
```
1. Install the dev dependencies
```powershell
npm install 
```
1. Start working! (Spins up harp server with browser sync in case you were interested)
```powershell 
gulp
```
